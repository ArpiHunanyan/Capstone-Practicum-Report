# Capstone Practicum: Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks for Pre-Clinical Cardiac Hyperspectral Image Classification

This repository contains the Capstone Practicum Report authored by **Arpi Hunanyan** as part of the Master of Science in Computer and Information Science (MSCIS) program at the American University of Armenia (AUA), completed in May 2024.

## About the Project

This practicum was conducted in collaboration with the **Zaven P. and Sonia Akian College of Science and Engineering (CSE)** and supported by the **Afeyan Family Foundation**. The research focuses on developing deep learning methods for the **automated segmentation and classification of hyperspectral images (HSI)** of atrial tissue treated via **radiofrequency ablation** — a critical procedure for managing cardiac arrhythmias.

Our work evaluates the applicability of **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, **graph convolutional networks (GCNs)**, and **transformer-based architectures** to detect and classify ablated tissue in multi-dimensional pre-clinical HSI datasets.

## Key Contributions

- Developed Python-based preprocessing pipelines for hyperspectral image datasets.
- Conducted a comprehensive literature review on state-of-the-art deep learning models for HSI classification.
- Trained and evaluated CNN, GCN, and Transformer models on cardiac tissue data.
- Participated in the BIO-SEE 2023 Annual Meeting with a scientific poster presentation.
- Contributed to writing a research paper for future journal publication.
